# HTML → Figma Architecture Guide

This document confirms that the repository implements the end-to-end system described in the outline and explains how each piece maps to concrete code. It also highlights the technical steps required to keep all components working together.

## 1. Technical Overview & Architecture

| Responsibility | Implementation in this repo |
| --- | --- |
| **Web scraping / rendering service** | Two options: <br>• `chrome-extension/` — live capture from the active browser tab, including screenshot + computed styles via the injected script and DOM extractor.<br>• `puppeteer-*.js` scripts — headless capture using Puppeteer (e.g. `puppeteer-auto-import.js`, `complete-automated-workflow.js`). These load arbitrary URLs, execute page scripts, and emit Figma-ready JSON. |
| **Figma plugin importer** | `figma-plugin/` — UI + main plugin code (`src/code.ts`) that receives schema payloads, builds frames, text, components, applies Auto Layout, and creates shared styles. |
| **Handoff channel** | `handoff-server.js` (Express) queues scrape jobs. The Chrome extension or Puppeteer backend posts payloads to `POST /jobs`; the Figma plugin UI polls `GET /jobs/next` for new work. |

System flow:
1. **Capture** – either via the Chrome extension in a live browser session or via Puppeteer in headless automation.
2. **Processing** – DOM + computed styles are normalized into the “schema” JSON (`DOMExtractor`, design tokens, Yoga layout in `server/yoga-processor.js`).
3. **Transfer** – payload posted to the handoff server queue.
4. **Import** – Figma plugin UI polls for jobs and forwards the payload to the main plugin code, which renders editable components.

## 2. Figma Plugin (Frontend) Checklist

The plugin complies with the outline’s requirements:

| Figma concept | Implementation reference |
| --- | --- |
| **Manifest & network access** | `figma-plugin/manifest.json` enables the UI HTML with localhost access so it can poll the handoff server. |
| **UI → main code messaging** | `figma-plugin/ui/index.html` polls `/jobs/next`, then posts `{ type: 'auto-import', data }` to the main plugin runtime. |
| **Frame & layer creation** | `figma-plugin/src/importer.ts`, `node-builder.ts`, `component-manager.ts` use `figma.createFrame`, `figma.createRectangle`, `figma.createText`, etc. |
| **Auto Layout mapping** | `style-manager.ts` and `node-builder.ts` translate flexbox/spacing metadata to `frame.layoutMode`, padding fields, and `itemSpacing`. |
| **Styles (fills, strokes, fonts)** | `style-manager.ts` sets `fills`, `strokes`, `cornerRadius`, `figma.loadFontAsync`, and registers shared color/text styles. |
| **Components & instances** | `component-manager.ts` deduplicates recurring nodes and creates main components + instances when the schema marks reusable elements. |
| **Progress UX** | `src/code.ts` posts progress updates; the UI shows import statistics, status lights, and auto-launches import when data arrives. |

If new HTML/CSS capabilities are added (e.g. gradients, shadows, nested Auto Layout), extend the schema first and then update the importer modules accordingly.

## 3. Backend Capture / Conversion Checklist

### 3.1 Headless capture (Puppeteer)

- **Scripts**: `puppeteer-auto-import.js`, `complete-automated-workflow.js`, `send-to-figma.js`, etc.
- **Functionality**: launch Chromium, open target URL, run the same `injected-script.js` DOM extractor inside the page, gather computed styles, and post the result to the handoff server.
- **Rendering fidelity**: includes `PageScroller` and design token extraction to force lazy-loaded content and build a usable style inventory.

### 3.2 Live capture (Chrome extension)

- **Content script** (`chrome-extension/src/content-script.ts`):
  - Injects `injected-script.js` and coordinates extraction.
  - Collects screenshot via background service worker (`background.ts`) and posts batched schema payloads to the handoff server (chunked transfer to avoid Chrome’s 32 MB message cap).
  - Shows progress overlay within the webpage.
- **Popup UI** (`src/popup/`):
  - Provides capture controls, status updates, preview card with screenshot, and shortcuts to send/preview the capture.
- **Background service worker** (`src/background.ts`):
  - Reassembles large payloads, posts JSON to `http://127.0.0.1:4411/jobs`, and handles screenshot requests.

### 3.3 Conversion algorithm

- **DOM Extraction**: `chrome-extension/src/utils/dom-extractor.ts` and `injected-script.ts` map DOM nodes, computed styles, and layout metadata into the Web-to-Figma schema.
- **Design tokens**: captured for colors, typography, spacing, shadows, border radii.
- **Yoga layout**: `server/yoga-processor.js` computes Auto Layout positions to mirror flex layouts accurately inside Figma.

## 4. Validation Steps

1. **Start the handoff server**  
   ```bash
   npm run handoff-server
   ```
2. **Capture a page**  
   - Via Chrome extension: open a non-internal URL, click “Capture Page” in the popup, wait for completion, confirm the preview appears, and verify the handoff LED turns green.  
   - Via Puppeteer: `node puppeteer-auto-import.js https://example.com`.
3. **Wait for Figma plugin auto-import**  
   - Open the plugin (`figma-plugin/dist/code.js` bundled version).  
   - Confirm the UI lights change to green, and the plugin begins importing automatically.
4. **Inspect the Figma canvas**  
   - Newly created page should contain Frames with Auto Layout, text nodes using real fonts, color styles applied, and components instantiated for repeating elements.
5. **Logs & troubleshooting**  
   - Handoff server logs queue events (`[handoff] received job …`).  
   - Chrome DevTools → Extensions background service worker for chunked transfer errors.  
   - Figma plugin console (⌘⌥I within Figma) for importer diagnostics.

## 5. Next Steps & Maintenance

- **Extend schema coverage**: add support for CSS Grid, SVGs, or complex filters by enhancing the extractor and updating the importer.
- **Asset handling**: pipeline images to remote storage and download them from the plugin if needed.
- **Performance**: monitor payload sizes; chunking is in place, but consider compressing or stripping unused markup for very large pages.
- **Testing**: use `test-extension.js` and `test-import.sh` (where applicable) to validate regression scenarios.

This documentation now mirrors the outline and confirms that the implementation satisfies all major architectural requirements. Update this file whenever the capture strategy, schema format, or importer behavior changes.
